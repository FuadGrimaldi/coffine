# E-Commerce API Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the E-Commerce API project, which is built using Laravel framework. The architecture follows a layered approach, separating concerns and promoting modularity and scalability.

## Architectural Layers

1. **Presentation Layer**

   - API Controllers
   - Request Validation
   - Response Formatting

2. **Application Layer**

   - Services
   - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

3. **Domain Layer**

   - Models
   - Repositories
   - Interfaces

4. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Database
   - External Services
   - Caching
   - Logging

## Key Components

### 1. API Controllers

Located in `app/Http/Controllers`, these handle incoming HTTP requests and return appropriate responses. They utilize services to process business logic.

### 2. Middleware

Located in `app/Http/Middleware`, these handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, CORS, and request/response manipulation.

### 3. Models

Located in `app/Models`, these represent the database tables and define relationships between entities.

### 4. Services

Located in `app/Services`, these encapsulate the core business logic of the application, separating it from the controllers.

### 5. Repositories

Located in `app/Repositories`, these abstract the data layer, providing a consistent interface for data operations.

### 6. Request Validation

Located in `app/Http/Requests`, these classes handle input validation for API requests.

### 7. API Resources

Located in `app/Http/Resources`, these transform the data for API responses, ensuring consistent output format.

## Database Design

The database design follows the structure outlined in the ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) provided in `documentation/desainDB.md`. It includes tables for users, products, categories, orders, payments, and more.

## Authentication

User authentication is handled using Laravel Sanctum, providing token-based authentication for API requests.

## API Documentation

API endpoints are documented using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, located in the `documentation/docs api/` directory.

## Scalability Considerations

- Use of caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Potential for horizontal scaling of web servers
- Database indexing for optimized query performance
- Consideration for future implementation of queue systems for background jobs

## Security Measures

- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Use of HTTPS for all communications
- Secure storage of sensitive information (e.g., passwords are hashed)
- Implementation of rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed in a containerized environment, facilitating easy scaling and management of the application infrastructure.
